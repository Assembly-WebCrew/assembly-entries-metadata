author:Antti Veräjäkorva|description:Presentation covers how Rovio handle DCC (Maya/Python mostly) plugins and scripts in multi-project and multi-team environment. Goal for any tool is to make things easier and this should start from the installation already. Setting up you computer, all tools and scripts can be annoying task and even daunting for newly joined team member. Doing initial setup and loading your tools poorly just result unmaintainable mess which won't support your project as well as it could. This talk will go through how we approach this at Rovio, some best practices and what pitfalls you should avoid. Aim of the talk is to give listener a solid understanding about how custom DCC tools are made to support real-life production requirements.</p><p>Antti started his career on 3D computer graphics back in 2003 and with games in 2005. Since that his career has been going through few AAA games(Alan Wake (and DLCs), Alan Wake American Nightmare, Quantum Break), mobile games (several, but none published), one VR game (P.O.L.L.E.N) and also VR camera development (Nokia Ozo) and now he is working at Rovio as Senior Technical Artist.|title:DCC tools setup|youtube:m0P0cpeuwos
author:Paul Greenfell|description:The Sinclair ZX Spectrum was released to the world in 1982. Not even the most powerful computer when launched, you can imagine how limited a platform it is by today's standards. With an awkwardly low screen resolution, a colour palette straight out of coder-art-school, a slow CPU and not even any custom hardware to make up for it, you would be forgiven for wondering how it ever survived. But survive it did, spawning several hardware updates and selling over 5 million units in the ten years that it lived. If the demoscene teaches us anything it's that limitations breed creativity. So it should come as no surprise to find that, along with other contemporary computers like the C64, the Spectrum branch of the demoscene is alive and well in 2018. In this seminar I will introduce you to the hardware of the ZX Spectrum 128 - the standard ZX demoscene platform. We will look at some techniques to coax 50hz music and visuals out of a machine that, in all honesty, barely has the CPU power to do so. I will show how these techniques can be built upon to make a modern Spectrum demo and I will provide the full source code and toolchain for a demo engine to start you off on your ZX demoscene journey.</p><p>Paul Grenfell has been a software developer since he was 8, growing up in the home computer boom of the 1980's. In the late 1990's while working in the UK games industry he got involved with the demoscene and never left. He has released a number of demoscene projects under the handle evilpaul for his demo group Ate Bit.|title:Retro demo scene coding - ZX Spectrum 101|youtube:M6Zi8xLCbMs

author:Niklas Tanskanen|description:Devops is all the buzz right now and comes with promises that by applying it you'll be doing faster, better and for less. But how should Devops practices, both cultural and tooling be applied when one is making games? In this talk I'll share some concrete ideas on how Devops could speed up your game development. Demos included ;)</p><p>Niklas Tanskanen is a seasoned consultant from Eficode, a leading devops house in the Nordics.
